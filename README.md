# Bidirectional LSTM for Sequence Classification

This project implements a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network for sequence classification tasks using PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This BiLSTM model is designed for sequence classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis or text categorization. It uses bidirectional LSTM layers to capture context from both directions in the input sequence.

## Model Architecture

The BiLSTM model consists of the following components:

- Embedding layer
- Bidirectional LSTM layer
- Dropout layer
- Fully connected layer

## Features

- Implementation of BiLSTM using PyTorch
- Training loop with progress bars using tqdm
- Top-K accuracy calculation
- Loss and accuracy visualization
- Model saving and loading functionality

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm
